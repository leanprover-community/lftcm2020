# Lean for the Curious Mathematician 2020

This repository hosts the Lean demos and exercises from the meeting
[Lean for the Curious Mathematician](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lftcm2020/),
held virtually in July 2020.
Recordings of the tutorials at this meeting are
[available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlF-CfQhukNlxexiNJErGJd2dte_J1t1N).

(The repository also hosts the meeting website, but you can ignore this.)

## Layout

In the `src` folder, you will find a number of subdirectories containing Lean files:

* `for_mathlib` contains some background material that you can ignore.
* `demos` contains some files that wre used during the category theory
  and linear algebra tutorials.
* `exercise_sources` contains exercises corresponding to each tutorial,
  organized by day.
* `hints` contains some helpful hints for these exercises.
* `solutions` contains completed exercises, if you're confused and want to peek.

## Getting started

We strongly recommend
[installing](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install)
Lean with its supporting tool `leanproject`.
Then you can get this project and open it in VSCode by running:
```
leanproject get lftcm2020
cp -r lftcm2020/src/exercises_sources/ lftcm2020/src/my_exercises
code lftcm2020
```

We recommend the second line which copies the exercises to a new directory.
Otherwise, if you try to update this project, your exercise solutions
could be overwritten or create merge conflicts.

Alternatively, the examples can be executed in browser with the following link:
